# The `functools` module

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook (`presentation.ipynb`) that covers a good chunk of the `functools` module from the Python standard library. We used this as part of the Boston Python study group's unit on the Python standard library.

The `exercises` folder contains a number of topic-specific exercises that you can try. Most of them are set up with an explanation at the top, a template to fill out, and then some assertions at the bottom. You'll know your solution is correct when you can run the script and it returns with no errors. Each exercise comes with an associated `<name>_SOLUTION.py` file if you want to look at the answers.
