    "Much of what's left is identical to what's here, except the decorators apply to instance methods, not functions (more on that later). The last bits of functionality that aren't covered by those parallels have to do with updating docstrings for wrapped functions on the fly (`@wraps`) and an esoteric way to create key functions (`@cmp_to_key`).
